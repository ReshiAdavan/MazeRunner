# MazeRunner

Honestly, when I first took Fundamentals of Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, I wasnt the greatest at it. So from inspiration online, I created a tool that would help me learn a few algorithms that I found to be the most difficult conceptually - graphing algorithms.

Boom. MazeRunner.

### Features

- A very appealing and aesthetic UI for visualizing how graphing algorithms work.
- Includes adaptability to input preset mazes or randomly generated ones of different dimensions. Can run the visualization at different speeds, with or without animations.
- A user can choose where the algorithm starts and stops. There is definitely a replay-ability factor here.

### Skills

- Programming languages: C++
- Libraries/Frameworks: SFML
- Other: Data Structures and Algorithms - DFS, BFS, Best First, Dijkstra's Algorithm
